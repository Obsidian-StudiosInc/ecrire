* Have "you have unsaved changes, do you want to close this without saving?" dialog.
* Undo/redo
  * Also add a stack limit? Replace should also affect undo/redo.
  * This is just an example policy, should possibly be implemented differently.
* When I implement different wrapping modes, make sure I count lines correctly.
* Support .swp files (autosave feature of elm?).
* Search -> wrap around, search backwards, case insensitive.
* Allow to manually override newline legacy mode?
* Go to line.
* Add save as.
* Font selection: Add checkbox to say: "Use default font".
* Font selection: Load the current values to the view.
* Font settings: Mark currently selected font in font settings. Keep a value saying if we are using the default font, or our own. Keep the size.
* Make a way in textblock or something to get the newly added format node, and then use it to store the node instead of searching for it later.
